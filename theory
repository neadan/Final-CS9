1. How would you explain docker's benefits to a colleague that has never heard of it? Include at least 2 benefits

2. A colleague would like to build an application that consists of multiple services:

shopping-front (frontend for the shopping service)
shopping-back (backend for the shopping service)
shopping-db (database for the shopping service)

They are wondering if docker-compose would be useful in their deployment.
What is your opinion? Do you think they should use docker-compose for deployment,
or is it better to use the docker pull/run commands? Please explain reasoning behind decision.

3. Give a specific example/use-case of why you would add a docker volume to a container. What are volumes used for?

4. From the following list, add either RUNTIME or BUILDTIME for the following elements:
(are they executed/used at runtime or build time?)

- docker run
- docker build
- docker-compose up -d
- Dockerfile
- docker logs -f <container_id>
- publishing ports
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- CMD flask run --host=0.0.0.0

5. What is the difference between a host port and a container port? What is their relationship to each other?
